      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Professional Programmers and Teachers – 335,000+ students. <br />
        The Learn Programming Academy was created by Tim Buchalka, a software
        developer with 35 years experience, who is also an instructor on Udemy,
        with over 335,000 students in his courses on Java, Android, Python and
        the Spring framework.
        <br /> The Academy’s goal in the next three years, is to teach one
        million people to learn how to program.
        <br /> Apart from Tim’s own courses, which are all available here, we
        are working with the very best teachers, creating courses to teach the
        essential skills required by developers, at all levels.
        <br /> One other important philosophy is that our courses are taught by
        real professionals, software developers with real and substantial
        experience in the industry, who are also great teachers.
        <br /> All our instructors are experienced software developers!
        <br /> Our team is busy creating new courses right now.
        <br /> Whether you are a beginner, looking to learn how to program for
        the very first time, or to brush up on your existing skills, or to learn
        new languages and frameworks, the Academy has you covered.

      <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
      <p>
        Tim’s mission is simple: to make a difference in your life by helping
        you to become a software developer. Tim does that through his Android,
        Python, Java and Spring Framework courses.
        <br /> When Tim started programming over thirty years ago, there was no
        online video training.
        <br /> There was no “easy” way to learn. The Internet, in its current
        form, didn’t exist, and as a result, Tim couldn’t “Google” for help, or
        watch videos on Youtube.
        <br /> After learning the hard way, Tim was determined to become the
        best teacher he could, and to make his training as painless as possible,
        so that you, or anyone else with the desire to become a software
        developer, could become one.
        <br /> In between doing that, Tim spent the best part of those years as
        a professional software developer writing applications in Java, and a
        variety of other languages. In addition he spent many years with J2EE,
        now known as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), designing and developing
        enterprise applications.
        <br /> Tim is relatively unique, in that he is a professional,
        experienced software developer who also has exceptional teaching skills.
        <br /> Many instructors have no work experience in the field! Make sure
        the person you trust with your education is a real expert with
        substantial previous professional experience.
        <br /> The bottom line for you is, when taking any of Tim’s courses, is
        that you will learn the right way to do things from an expert, in the
        shortest possible amount of time.
        <br /> Tim’s Java, Android, and Python courses, here on Udemy are of the
        highest quality as reviewed by his students. Tens of thousands of
        students, just like you, have taken his classes, thousands have left
        glowing reviews, and many have gone on to full-time jobs, or
        consulting/freelancing opportunities after completing one of his
        courses.
        <br /> Tim recently placed in the top ten Udemy instructors as voted for
        by his students and Udemy themselves.
